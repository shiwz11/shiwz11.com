# The Experimental Economics Of Religion{#Robert-Hoffmann-2011}

The paper discusses results obtained so far in terms of two roles of 
religion in shaping individual behaviour, that is, as a social group 
identifier and as a set of value.

Religious groups, in contrast, influence these interactions based on 
other's ingroup or outgroup status and can generate well-known group effects
such as ingroup favouritism and outgroup discrimination.

**Barro and McCleary (2003)** find that, across countries, average
religious service attendance is negatively associated with GDP growth.


**McCleary and Barro (2006)** in their instrumental variable mdoel higher
GDP per capita causes a reduction in average religiosity.

**Spurious correlations**: when certain state religious are internationally
associated with lower economic performance, both may be results of particular 
historical, geo-political or geographical trajectories rather than direct
influence on each other.

## Definition and Measurement of Individual Religion
  
Argyle and Beit-Hallahmi (1975, p. 1), religion is "a system of beliefs in a divine or superhuman power, and practices of worship or other rituals directed twoards such a power".Other commentators add dimensions of religious emotions and experience, as well as effects of religious belonging on behaviour in secualr contexts (Spinks, 1963, p. 8).


```{block2, type = 'liter'}
Most scholars accept the multi-dimensionality of religiosity (Dejong et al., 1976).

A volume edited by Hill and Hood (1999) contains over 120 of these measuring the dimensitions discussed here.

Schoenfeld's (1978) attitude surver of over 1500 U.S. respondents he additionally finds hints 
of a curvilinear relationship between trust and religiosity: in particular, there was greater
mistrust among high-attendance individuals and members of more fundamentalist churches.

Bahr and Martin (1983) found that faith in people was related to a three-way classification of 
church attendance, but less strongly than with non-religious variables such as school grades 
and parental socio-economic status.

> Particularly disappointing were my efforts to find any empirical support ofr the proposition that
religion sustains conformity to the normative order [...] Even with large samples and hundres of 
survery items to work with I was unabel to find any clear patterns of religious effects. Noe of the
many measures of religious commitment seemed to matter on a whole range of attitudes adn social 
activities. (Start, 1984, p. 273, 281)

## Experimental Economics

There are two related was in which experimentalists are trying to improve the realism of the decisions
they observe.

First, field studies in naturalistic settings are being proposed as a way of avoiding the distorting 
effects artificial laboratory settings may have on subject behaviour (Harrison and List, 2004).

Second, new recruiment techniques and sampling locations are being used to overcome the reliance of 
experimentalists on Wstern college students to generate results (e.g. Henrich et al., 2004; Cardenas and Carpenter, 2008;
Chesney et al., 2009).

## Experimental Economics and Religion

A large general literature in experimental economics has estabilished a number of factors that affect
thrust in sendign and responding (in a Trust Game), includeing attitudes to risk, demographics (cluture, 
gender and age) as well as strucural variables in the experiment such as anonymity (see Camerer, 2003, pp. 86 
for an overview).

Sometimes (or most times) ethnicity rather than religion was the group identigier (Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001; Burns, 
2006; Chuah et al., 2007).


Tan and Vogel (2008) found that senders' religiosity as an independent variable fails to predict their behaviour 
in any of the models presented.

A tempting alternative explanation would be that religiosity plays the role of a 
group identifier and generates ingroup favouritism.

Shariff and NOrenzayan (2007) 所用的暗示方法同时增加了独裁者博弈中的控制组和对照组的捐献量。
且结果在两组中都显著。

Malhotra (2010) examins bidding behaviour in a field experiment [...] looking at Sunday auctions, 
he finds that re-bidding probability is significantly higher in religious (40%) compared with 
non-religious (12%) subjects. On the other days, re-bidding was similar for both groups (around 26%).
The interpretation is that Sunday served as a prime that activated religous norms in religous subjects.

> there are robust effects to be found if we cease being *de facto* psychologists and [...] 
stop treating religion only as an individual trait, and seek its collective effects 
(Stark, 1984, p. 281).

# A theorist's view of experiments

## From theory to experiments

The primitives of Nash's (two-person) bargaining problem are the "feasibel set" 
and a "disagreement point".

Researchers tried to design experimental environments in which the
main factors influencing the outcome were the attitudes of the players 
towards risk.

# Chinese values and negotitation behaviour: A bargaining experiment

```{block2, type='liter'}
Bond and Shtin, 1987 studied how Chinese cultural values potentially influence Chinese negotiation behaviour.

Fang, Zhao, and Worm, 2008; Ghauri and Fang, 2001; Graham and Lam, 2003; Kirkbride, Tang, and Westwood, 1991
```

empirical studies of behaviour such as self-reports of past of intended bahaviour, simulated
negotiation scenarios or ethnography are prone to response and other biases (Chandon, Morwitz, and Reinartz, 2005)

```{block2, type='liter'}

## Chinese cultural values

1. Harmony

2. Face

```{block2, type='liter'}
Earley, 1997
```

A number of studies have hypothesised a link between the Chinese concept of face and negotiation
behaviour (Earlye, 1997; Ghauri and Fang, 2001; Graham and Lam, 2003; Kim, 2008; Kirkbride et al., 1991;
Kumar and Worm, 2003)

The importance of preserving one's own and others' face means that Chinese people tend to avoid
conflict and confrontation if possible, and adopt more compromising negotitation behaviours.

3. Winning

## Chinese stratugic behaviour

Survey questionnaire may suffer from response biases associated with self reports (e.g. Chandon et al., 2005)

```{block2, type='liter'}

```

**Chuah, Hoffmann, Jones, and Williams (2009)** detected differences in ultiatum game offer leves between Malaysian Chinese 
and U.K. subjects which are explained with respect to differences between these groups in a host of universal social attitudes 
elicited via the World Values Survey questionnaire.

**Buchan, Johnson, adn Croson (2006)** : examin the effect of social distance on trust game behaviour among American and 
Chinese subject pairs respectively.

**Hypothesis** : 

1. Concern for harmony is negatively associated with competitive bargaining decisions.

2. Concern for face is negatively associated with competitive bargaining decisions.

3. Concern for winning is positively associated with competitive bargaining decisitions.

4. Risk seekingness is positively associated with competitive bargaining decisions.

```{block2, type='liter'}
Morris and Gelfand (2004) argues that Chinese face concern is not activated in all situations but only by 
specific contexts.
```

**Gelfand and Dyer (2000) (2000, pp. 87-88)** : argue that negotiation deadlines and time pressure activate 
culturally shared schemata.

5. Cultural values are expressed more in the final, critical stage of the bargaining process.
